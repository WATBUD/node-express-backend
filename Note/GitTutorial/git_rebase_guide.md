# Understanding `git rebase`

## What `git rebase` Does

`git rebase` moves or combines a sequence of commits to a new base commit. It does not "go back to the base point," but rather it re-applies commits from your current branch onto another base commit.

### Main Purposes of `git rebase`

1. **Tidying Up Commit History**: During development, you may have many scattered commits. With `git rebase -i` (interactive rebase), you can tidy these commits by combining, editing commit messages, or reordering them to make the commit history cleaner.

2. **Rebasing a Branch onto the Latest Base**: When your branch falls behind the main branch, you can use `git rebase` to update the base of your branch to the latest commit of the main branch. For example, if you are working on a `feature` branch and the `main` branch has new commits, you can use `git rebase main` to move the base of the `feature` branch to the latest commit of `main`.

### Example

```bash
# On the feature branch
git checkout feature

# Rebase the feature branch onto the latest commit of the main branch
git rebase main
```

This will re-apply the commits from the `feature` branch on top of the latest commit of the `main` branch, so the `feature` branch includes the latest changes from `main`.

# After resolving conflicts, mark them as resolved
git add <resolved files>

# Continue the rebase process
git rebase --continue

# Start an interactive rebase
git rebase -i HEAD~n

# Force push the changes to the remote branch
git push origin feature --force







### Example Scenario

Suppose you have the following commit history:

```
A---B---C---D  (main)
     \
      E---F---G  (feature)
```

Here, the `main` branch has commits `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, and the `feature` branch, based on `B`, has commits `E`, `F`, `G`.

Now, you want to rebase the `feature` branch onto the latest commit `D` of the `main` branch. You would do this:

```bash
git checkout feature
git rebase main
```

`git rebase` will do the following:

1. Remove commits `E`, `F`, `G` from the `feature` branch.
2. Move the `feature` branch to the latest commit `D` of the `main` branch.
3. Re-apply commits `E`, `F`, `G` in order on top of `D`.

The result will be:

```
A---B---C---D  (main)
             \
              E'---F'---G'  (feature)
```

Now, the base of the `feature` branch is the latest commit `D` of the `main` branch, and the commits `E`, `F`, `G` have been re-applied on top of `D`. These new commits will have new hash values (`E'`, `F'`, `G'`) because their base commit has changed.

This is the main purpose of `git rebase`: to re-apply commits from a branch onto a new base commit, resulting in a linear commit history.
